excerpt: Facebook is under the pump. Should it pick a side?
---
<p>Facebook has been at the centre of the political spectrum, and for all the wrong reasons. Once heralded as the greatest thing on the Internet, has now been reduced down to defending accusations of enabling its users and other in manipulating state elections.</p>
<p>I recently read an article on the New York Times, and it highlights the problem lying at the bottom of Facebook. Its leaders are making promises, and are later unable to hold them up. The promises and the failure to uphold them shows the great confusion that has consumed Facebook and its leadership.</p>
<p>Facebook has tied up with many of the leading fact-checking agencies to prevent misinformation from creeping into feeds. Their model relies on down-ranking the posts flagged as incorrect or false. The immediate counter argument to such actions has been the invocation of the First Amendment in the United States.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, I think the Facebook leadership does not have the resources to stop false claims and misinformation from creeping into the users' feed. Facebook needs to pick a side on each issue and mark down its policy.</p>
<p>In the New York Times article, it was mentioned that there are naysayers of the Holocaust. I doubt there is any disagreement about what happened, and in that, I feel that Facebook needs to pick a side: the truth or the alternate notion.</p>
<p>While the shareholders may revolt, or face serious loss of wealth, I feel it is the next step for Facebook if it wants to stay in the forefront of the internet experience.</p>
