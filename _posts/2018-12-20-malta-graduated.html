<p>Malta Inc. is the newest company that stepped out of X, the moonshot factory. I am currently working on thermal energy storage systems, so this is super exciting for me.</p>

<p>Malta Inc. is trying to design a thermal energy storage system using molten salts to combat the variation in electricity generation due to renewables.</p>

<p>It would be really interesting to see where the company goes with the project and if the real-life scenario makes business sense. Previous research has indicated that this technology could be useful. Large number of companies also exist that provide thermal energy storage solutions.</p>

<p>I am really excited to an X graduate in the energy storage space. I hope with strong backing from Google and Alphabet, we can see some amazing thermal energy storage systems in the near future.</p>
