<p>I just finished watching "The Great Hack" on Netflix. The Netflix film focuses on how Cambridge Analytica (CA)/ SCL Groups "hacked" more than a dozen political elections to get a positive result for their clients. I use the word "hacked" here as: (i) it is in the title of the film, and (ii) I want you to actually stop and think what just happened. As Carole Cadwalladr put it in the series, the work done by CA is- as the military would describe it- a "psy-ops" (psychological operation). Sounds alarming, doesn't it? </p>

<p>To me, before 2016, I was nonchalant about data privacy. I would occasionally freak out about how my Google Search would know I really wanted to watch an Indie movie, but that was the extent of it. After 2016 and the subsequent revelations from the  CA scandal, I grew nervous about my data. I learned how companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon used my data to create a digital profile of myself. They used the data on this digital profile to accurately predict what I would do next and suggest me content accordingly. This would range from things as inconsequential as what I would want to eat when I googled restaurants nearby to downright manipulative as suggesting a news outlet that would fit my view of the world. </p>

<p>I am not sure about how you feel about this, but I was pretty angry with these companies. I started a cleansing process to rid myself of all accounts and links to these companies. One golden rule I stuck to was: "If they are giving a product/service to you for free, you are the product." I feel I was fairly successful at erasing my life from the databases of those companies. I felt good about myself. But then life happened. I had to start using the products of the those companies again as I everyone else around me was not having the same outrage I was having. I was paying a price for caring about my privacy. (Sotto voce: WHAT!?)</p>

<p>Back to "The Great Hack" and the idea of "psy-ops". On paper, this is not a bad idea, does it? The military could either obliterate a town/city, or ask the opposition to surrender. How do they do it? By using the two things every human reacts strongly to: fear and anger. They instill fear and rage in the population and turn the masses against the current ruler (for the lack of a better word).</p>

<p>This has been done throughout history: the US dropped phamlets over Hiroshima and Nagasaki urging the citizens to surrender. Doesn't seem like the wrong thing to do given they planned to drop atomic bombs on those cities, right? Now, what if the Nazi's did the same thing to the Allies? You would have felt a pinch, I am sure. Now what if I told you they actually did this at Dunkirk? Should the Allies have surrendered? I think here we are in this great moral dilemma: who is correct- the aggressor or the retaliator?</p>

<p>CA conducted a similar psychological operation on unsuspecting people all around the world. To take an effect on election results, they targeted the undecided voters, the "persuadables" as they like to call them. CA painted a world that fit the narrative that their client wanted the "persuadables" to see based on the two emotions we strongly react to: fear and anger. The "persuadables" now were gently nudged in the direction that CA wanted. Come Election Day, they would vote for the client that hired CA, and why wouldn't they? What if I told you that if you elected person X, you will have to share your house with some dangerous people and provided you with no other view. What if I bombarded you with this for weeks and months? Why wouldn't you do whatever you can to not elect person X? It makes sense, right? And this is the problem.</p>

<p>CA often fed duplicitous information to the "persuadables". They misrepresented facts often focussing on the small inconvenience and blowing it out of proportion. The next question that comes up is how are they able to target the "persuadables" so accurately? The beauty and horror is in its simplicity: you need not persuade all "persuadables", you only need to persuade the ones that belong to swing states. Gaming the system to gain an advantage is the hallmark of their approach. And our favorite tech giants are more than happy to oblige if they are paid handsomely. These tech giants would use targeted advertisements to sway to "persuadables" and the results would indicate they succeeded.</p>

<p>Now if your blood is boiling after hearing this, let me try to allay you by saying that they did not do anything illegal. Haha! Probably too much, right? I know.</p>

<p>Ironically, if you read this and decided to obtain more information about this, did I just perform a "psy-ops" on you?</p>
