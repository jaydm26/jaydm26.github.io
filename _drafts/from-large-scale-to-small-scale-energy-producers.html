<p>Energy production and distribution has been a large corporate thing right from its start. The last remnants of the Edison DC Current grid was turned off in 2007 (<a href="https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/off-goes-the-power-current-started-by-thomas-edison/">Off Goes the Power Current Started by Thomas Edison</a>).</p>
<p>The electrical grids and sub grids that light up our houses have been relatively the same since the original grid laid down by Edison.</p>

<p>The general layout of the electrical grid. The most radical change I have heard in recent times is how an IoT device will only consume energy when the cost of electricity is lowest. That's about to change now. Elon Musk and Tesla (and SolarCity) are powering their way into house will solar panels and a Powerwall. The solar panels not only provide electricity for your house during the day, but also during the night using the Powerwall. What is remarkable is how the Powerwall can be used to provide electricity to the grid as well. (Of course in times of need, the grid can also be used to provide electricity to your house.)Every household in the suburb now can be its own power station. This opens up a variety of possibilities. I am very excited to see a future where suburban communities around major cities become independent of the grid through renewable sources of energy like wind and solar. This will surely trickle down to benefits for the ones who do not have the facility of 24 hour electricity. Renewable, especially solar energy, is abundant. If we can use it in an effective manner, I believe that there will be a future where electricity will no longer be a luxury to the rural and poor parts of the world.</p>
