<p>So was part I a "psy-ops"?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The jury is out for that one. On the hand, I had an intention to raise the alarm bells in the mind of the reader. On the other, I did give you a choice to read on or close the tab and walk away.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is what Cambridge Analytica (CA) argued. While they influenced the minds of the "persuadables", they believed that each individual had the choice to vote for any candidate on the ballot. But after being scared and enraged by the content they have been fed for often months, do you think they would be making an informed choice? In their minds, they have made an informed choice. But this informed choice could be miles away from reality.</p>

<p>This is where I urge everyone to consider where you stand on data privacy. Sharing data with the tech giants has provided us with this comfortable life that we live. At the same time, it has enabled companies like CA to use the data to map each and every person to influence their decisions. I believe there is a sweet-spot- a case where we can be happy to share data for a better experience without fearing that we are being fed curated content to influence our opinions. Further, it should be stressed that better user experience does not equate to being siloed into an echo chamber.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>But that begs the question: how will the tech giants, who have grown so used to earning multi-billion dollar revenues, maintain their margins? Of course, these companies will want to push back against any legislative process that takes an aim at their profits. Being an optimist, I am sure if a strong data privacy laws got enacted, there will be a company or a service somewhere that will respect the law and still give you an amazing experience. </p>

<p>In part III, I put forth the question to every reader: Where do you stand on data privacy?</p>
