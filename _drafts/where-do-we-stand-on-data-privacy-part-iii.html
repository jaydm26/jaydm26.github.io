<p>Now that I have established a reason to be worried, it is now time to pose the question to every reader: Where do you stand on Data Privacy?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The current system has failed us miserably. Tech companies and law makers are unable to produce the results we as users expect. Lack of clarity and transparency, combined with our own disregard to read terms and conditions has led to this fiasco. Here, we could advocate for stronger privacy laws or greater regulation. We could also urge the tech companies be more responsible with our data. Just like with a bank, we expect them to safeguard our valuables (in this case, our data). </p>

<p>I have often heard of the requirement for data sharing become an opt-in system as opposed to the current opt-out system. This basically means that when you enroll for a service, for example say on Google, your data is not being collected. You would have to specifically enable this to allow Google to access your data and use it to curate your content. You should also be in absolute control of what data you are sharing with Google.</p>

<p>Tech companies will obviously dislike this kind of system as they will not be able to collect your data immediately. This would eat into their margins and revenue. But at this time, the fundamental question is: Are businesses going to put profits over doing the morally right thing? If the answer is yes (which it seems to be), we are living in a dystopia and there is a dire need to correct the direction of this ship. If the answer is no, stronger actions from the boards of these companies are required as what we have does not seem to be enough.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>On a closing note, I would like to stress on the point of our position on data privacy again. I believe it is time we start taking better care of our data and how it is being used. Tech companies have to be equally responsible in ensuring that our data is not used for ill-purposes. We as users have to advocate for these laws now, before the Orwellian 1984 becomes a reality.</p>
