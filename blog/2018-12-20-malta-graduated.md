Malta Inc. is the newest company that stepped out of X, the moonshot factory. I am currently working on thermal energy storage systems, so this is super exciting for me.

Malta Inc. is trying to design a thermal energy storage system using molten salts to combat the variation in electricity generation due to renewables.

It would be really interesting to see where the company goes with the project and if the real-life scenario makes business sense. Previous research has indicated that this technology could be useful. Large number of companies also exist that provide thermal energy storage solutions.

I am really excited to an X graduate in the energy storage space. I hope with strong backing from Google and Alphabet, we can see some amazing thermal energy storage systems in the near future.
