### About Me

Hello!


I am Jay Mehta. I recently graduated from UCLA with a Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering. My studies at UCLA focussed on the flow of fluid and heat. I developed an excellent foundation in these subjects. Further, I found a strong passion for the field of computational science and numerical analysis.

Before UCLA, I was a student studying at the Shri Vile Parle Kelvani Mandal's Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (affiliated to University of Mumbai). I am completed my Bachelors degree in Engineering with a specialisation in Mechanical Engineering.

During my academic life, I came across comprehensive and deep concepts and ideas in mechanical engineering. Right from freshman year till senior year and graduate school, I was pushing the boundaries of my knowledge to learn more and in-depth, so that I have the technical skills to make it in the big, scary world! I am currently looking for full-time opportunities to work in the field of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

On this website, you will find my experiences, educational material, and my views on topics that I am interested in. I want this website to reflect who I am and tell my story.
