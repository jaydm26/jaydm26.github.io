Hello!

I am Jay Mehta. I recently graduated from UCLA with a Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering. My studies at UCLA focussed on the flow of fluid and heat. I developed an excellent foundation in these subjects. Further, I found a strong passion for the field of computational and mathematical engineering.

Before UCLA, I was a student studying at the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal's Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (affiliated to University of Mumbai). I am completed my Bachelors degree in Engineering with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering.

During my academic life, I came across comprehensive and deep concepts and ideas in mechanical engineering. Right from freshman year till senior year and graduate school, I was pushing the boundaries of my knowledge to learn more and in-depth, so that I have the technical skills to make it in the big, scary world! I am currently looking for full-time opportunities to work in the field of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

I am curious learner and thus embark on various projects which I have completed with varying degrees of success. Most importantly, and in part due to my background and interests, I am able to gain insights into topics that are generally considered independent from each other (like turbulence in fluid mechanics and machine learning).

On this website, you will find my portfolio, other insights I have drawn from courses, projects and interactions with colleagues. You can also find my personal blog with my views on topics that I am interested in. This website reflects who I am and tells my story.
