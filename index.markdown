Welcome to my website! I am Jay Mehta, a Mechanical Engineer with a Masters from the University of California, Los Angeles. Broadly, I am interested in the field of computational and mathematical engineering. I have worked on various projects in the past where computational methods were involved to varying degrees. You can find links to the projects in my [portfolio]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio) (or alternatively, find the source code on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jaydm26)).
